# Master of Arts in Teaching

I earned my Masters in Teaching at Piedmont College (now Piedmont University) Through the Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship (now Citizens and Scholars.)  In this time, I collected and reflected on my own personal growth as an eudcator while developing what I would now consider my own teaching pedagogy.  

In this time, I became certified to teach broadfield science (6-12), and technology/engineering education.  I also became certified in AP computer science.

Below are some of the writings I completed throughout this program reflecting on essential questions of educators, and skills I developed throughout my teaching internship and later career.  I have kept the writings the same as I had them when I was completing the program as to allow for further reflection as I continue in my teaching journey.
