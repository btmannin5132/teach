# Intern Keys

While teaching, there are many topics that teachers should reflect on regularly.  During my intern experience at Sims Academy, I was regularly observed by another teacher at the school, along with a faculty member from Piedmont college.  Between their support and guidance on these topics, I compiled how I will continue to reflect on and improve my teaching ability for the rest of my teaching career.

## Academically Challenging Environment

:::{dropdown}

The teacher candidate creates a student-centered, academic environment in which teaching and learning occur at high levels and students are self-directed learners.

### What:

In order for students to stay effectively engaged in the classroom, they have to be challenged.  If students are not properly challenged, as in the content is either too difficult or too easy, the students will not be motivated to participate.  Allowing for students to be properly challenged, and expanding their zone of proximal development, effective teaching can occur.

### So What:

Students need to be challenged in order to succeed in any class.  In Mechatronics, this is exceptionally simple to do considering it is a a lot of different, difficult content areas combined into one class, and it the issue comes in making sure that the difficulty is appropriate for the ability levels of the students.  The key for this is differentiation. If I can make an assessment that a wide variety of students can complete at and slightly above their own ability level, I can get them to learn the content, and be properly challenged throughout the assessment. For example, the final project that Mechatronics was to do this semester was make a device that is practical, has a variety of inputs, and is autonomous.  This project hits on the mechanical, electrical, and programming standards of Mechatronics, and can be as simple or complex as the students want to make it. Students that want to go above and beyond can do so as well, as one of my students is trying to make a maze plotter in multiple dimensions. This project goes on to collaborate with the student’s Computer Science class, which focuses more on what he is hoping to do as a career.  

### Now What:

Proper assessments allow for me to see the ability level of my students, which allows me to adjust projects and assignments to be more or less challenging for the students as they develop in the content.  Making sure that the students are properly challenged, and being able to enjoy the content is critical for their success in any class, especially Mechatronics.

## Assessment Strategies

:::{dropdown}

The teacher candidate systematically chooses a variety of diagnostic, formative, and summative assessment strategies and instruments that are valid and appropriate for the content and student population.

### What:

Assessments come in all shapes and sizes, and have different purposes.  Using assessments in a variety of ways, assessing for different skills and knowledge bases can allow for a teacher to effectively determine where students are struggling in a topic, or if they are ready to move on.

### So What:

Assessments are very useful to determine where students are in terms of learning a topic.  Some assessments are meant to show how well they can take an interpret data, and use it to apply previous knowledge, such as labs.  For example, a lab that focuses on creating logic circuits and equations draws on students’ previous knowledge on logic gates. Assessments can also be used to bring up a new topic that links with a previous one, like showing the relationship between logic and programming.  Formal assessments can be used to show how far a student has come in a topic, such as asking them to take a process, and turn it into a program that can be used by a computer, and also do the reverse, where they have to make sense of a program, and apply it to real life. Assessments can also be as simple as taking a show of hand at the end of a lesson to see where the class stands on a topic.  If a teacher sees that there are still a lot of students struggling on a topic, they then know that they need to spend more time on the topic, and possibly find a different instructional strategy.

### Now What:

The CTAE classes in Georgia are their own beast to assess for learning.  Since most of these classes, including Mechatronics, mostly try to assess for mastery, assessments are often non-traditional, focusing on skills assessments instead of written tests.  These practices have their pros and cons. While the assessments are able to test for practical knowledge on a topic, they are often more subjective than written tests, which can be difficult to assign a grade. I will have to be very careful of this when teaching in the future.

## Assessment Uses

:::{dropdown}

The teacher candidate systematically gathers, analyzes, and uses relevant data to measure student progress, to inform instructional content and delivery methods, and to provide timely and constructive feedback to both students and parents.

### What: 

Once an assessment has been issued, a teacher needs to analyze the data to better understand what the assessment is showing, and not just issue a grade. Assessments are used to determine depth of knowledge, and applications of concepts, and should be used as such. 

### So What: 

Teachers should use assessments that effectively reflect the ability or content knowledge of their students. Determining this is more than just looking at the final grade, but possibly looking at each question individually, and determining if the questions were fair depending on the distribution of answers. With multiple-choice assessments, this can be done a variety of ways, such as looking at specific questions, and how many students got it correct, or even looking at the frequency other answers were stated in comparison to the correct one. This method is especially useful as it might be able to point out misconceptions that the students might have on a topic. It is also important for teachers to realize what type of assessments they are using, based on if they are formal or informal, formative or summative. The proper combination between these different types of assessments, with effective feedback, will allow teachers to assess a student’s progress and mastery of a topic, the ultimate goal for the class. 

### Now What: 

In Mechatronics, there are three leveled classes. There is a state exam at the end of the third level, and it encompasses all three classes. In the meantime, mastery can be assessed for the in-between topics rather effectively using labs and skill assessments with the students. I will make sure to vary my assessment strategies, and analyze formal assessments for proper development, and provide effective feedback to the students. If students are able to effectively communicate that they are developing mastery of the content, I am confident that with some standard testing practice, they will be able to pass the exam at the end of the pathway.

## Communication

:::{dropdown}

The teacher candidate communicates effectively with students, parents or guardians, district and school personnel, and other stakeholders in ways that enhance student learning.

### What:

Communication is important in any profession.  In teaching, it is critical to maintain contact with parents, and students to make sure that they are aware of their position in your class.  This is often a thankless task, but it is important for both the students, and for personal liability to maintain this contact.

### So What:

In many school districts, if proper contact is not maintained with students that are failing a class, administrators often have to pass the student, regardless of their ability or effort in the class.  It is because of this that contact between a teacher and a student’s parents is imperative, and can lead to confrontation between the teacher and the parents. In other times, communication between students and parents is much more enjoyable.  I really enjoy telling parents about how well students are doing in my class, or answering additional questions about a topic if the students want to dig further. I have even had a parent ask me if I would be willing to help them better understand the topic.  The parent is going back to school to learn Mechatronics, and was looking for some additional support. I have now been assisting them since late March, and it has been a great experience watching both parents and students see the importance of this field.

### Now What:

It is my job as an educator to make sure that students and parents have effective resources for the students to be successful in my classroom.  Because of this, I will continue to provide effective communication to both students and parents when they request it, and when I also see necessary.  While I know that this can case a sour relationship between me and the parents at times, I feel that it is a necessary step to take to try to ensure the success of the student in my classroom.

## Differentiated Instruction

:::{dropdown}

The teacher candidate challenges and supports each student’s learning by providing appropriate content and developing skills which address individual learning differences.

### What:

Differentiation allow for teachers to reach a larger amount of students with the same lesson.  It is often thought that differentiation is difficult, but it mainly just takes a different way of looking at how the information is trying to be presented to the students.  

### So What:

Being able to supply enough direction for students to get a proper understanding of what you expect from them, but allowing them to take their own path to get to the final product is very useful in applied fields such as mechatronics.  Since mechatronics encompasses many different STEM fields, it is impractical to try to make everyone take the same approach to learning the material. For example, one of the main topics in mechatronics is learning how to make a process automated, or without human interaction.  This is usually done by sensors taking in information, and then being processed by a computer. This has applications in any field, it just depends on what sensors are being used, and how they are being used. Allowing the students to choose what sensors and devices to analyze can allow for them to analyze simplistic devices, or more technical ones depending on their motivation and ability level.  When I did this with my class, I was even able to play the “I don’t know what some of these sensors do, so you need to find out for me” card, which adds another layer of interest for many students, as they get to teach the teacher.

### Now What:

In my case, differentiation is fairly straightforward, since it is simple to allow students to go their own way in mechatronics.  It is important that students develop skills in a proper order, however; so allowing students to go at their own pace to develop mastery is critical.  This should be simple enough to do in my classes, since most are student-led with the teacher providing support when needed. Projects can be effectively adjusted for students ability levels without much effort, and can be easily modified to meet a student’s interests depending on their passions or career choices.

## Instructional Planning

:::{dropdown}

The teacher candidate plans using state and local school district curricula and standards, effective strategies, resources, and data to address the different needs of all students.

### What:

As teachers plan for the next units, or even the next lesson in a class, they have to consider how progressed the students are in the content, and how they will respond to the new material.  If the material is too advanced, or not advanced enough, the students will zone out, and the content will not stick with them. Student’s motivation should also be assessed.

### So What:

Teachers need to know their students well enough to properly determine how they will learn the material.  In my case, this was a difficult scenario, as I started teaching Mechatronics in the middle of March, so I had to both assess my students’ progress, as well as develop new lesson plans within a matter of days to make sure that we stayed on track to address all of the standards needed to address.  Surveys of students are a good way to get this information quickly and effectively, like I did to determine where I would need to start with programming. When we first started programming in this class, virtually everyone in the class needed to learn how to program an Arduino or programmable logic controller, which would take a large amount of time.  Determining grade gaps can often show the motivation of students in the class. When I see that there is over a 20% standard deviation of the grades in the class, I know that there is more going on than with my students than just not understanding the material. Planning for these gaps can help a teacher properly develop plans that can differentiate for those that are engaged, and for those that might be lacking some motivation.

### Now What:

Since mechatronics is a difficult topic since students will range very widely in prior experience with the topic, surveys will be very useful to determine where students are at in the content. With proper planning and with effective differentiation, I will be able to teach a wide range of students at the same time while still teaching every student the skills needed to be successful in the class.

:::

## Instructional Strategies

:::{dropdown}

The teacher candidate promotes student learning by using research-based instructional strategies relevant to the content to engage students in active learning and to facilitate the students’ acquisition of key knowledge and skills.

### What:

Different material should be taught in different ways.  Lecture does not fit for teaching how to program, instead, programming should probably be taught with students in front of a computer with a guided tutorial.  Varying instructional strategies depending on what is being taught not only helps keep things interesting in the classroom, but will help the students stay engaged, and learn the material more effectively.

### So What:

It is critical for teachers to vary their instruction to keep students engaged in the classroom.  Depending on what is being taught, the instruction strategy used will change. When teaching a new skill, such as how to diagnose logic circuits, a hands-on tutorial would be very practical. If one is trying to get students passionate about an issue, such as the population problem on Earth, a satire presentation describing a ludacris view on the topic might be more appropriate.  Making sure that the instructional method is practical, applicable, and not a time-filler is very important, as it helps show the importance of the topic, and allows students to develop the needed skills or view points needed to be successful in the class.

### Now What:

Finding new and fun instructional strategies for me to teach mechatronics is something I enjoy doing, as I like learning things in different ways, even if it is learning something again that I already know, but I am learning it in a different way.  This allows me to compare and contrast different teaching methods for the same topic, and can allow me to figure out the best way to teach the material to the students. Since the majority of mechatronics is developing effective skills in the field, and little book work, I focus a lot on finding fun and useful projects or activities that the students can do to learn various skills.  This also helps me better learn the material.

## Positive Learning Environment

:::{dropdown}

The teacher candidate provides a well-managed, safe, and orderly environment that is conducive to learning and encourages respect for all.

### What:

Students need to feel like they belong in the classroom, that they are safe, and that they are able to learn in the classroom.  If these characteristics are not part of the classroom, it will not be a productive workspace for students or teachers alike.

### So What:

In order for students to be able to learn, they have to be able to feel safe, to feel that they can set aside issues that might be going on around them, and learn.  The best way that I can do this is promote the joy of discovery in my students. If I can keep my students engaged in learning and finding out new things, they will want to learn and develop new skills.  One of my favorite ways to do this is promote logical arguing in my classroom. This involves using logic and what we know about our reality to defend a viewpoint. An entertaining way to do this is giving students a hypothetical question that does not have a right or wrong answer, and allow students to discuss, argue, and defend their point of view on it.  This promotes critical thought and develops arguing skills without any risk associated with it, which creates a safe and enjoyable space for everyone. Once students are able and willing to argue hypothetical concepts, we can move onto more applicable topics that might open a can of worms, but with the foundation of logical arguing, these topics can seem more approachable.

### Now What:

I will continue to promote critical thought through arguing.  I have already had many great arguments about a wide variety of topics with my students, and making sure that we keep the arguments logical, we have even had some good arguments about the recent political controversies, and the changes that are going on in the Boy Scouts of America. If I am able to have these types of arguments with my students, and we can all walk away from the argument on common ground, and having learned something in the process, I think that I have been successful in creating an inclusive classroom.

## Professional Knowledge

:::{dropdown}

The teacher candidate demonstrates an understanding of the curriculum, subject content, pedagogical knowledge, and the needs of students by providing relevant learning experiences.

### What:

It is critical for teachers to have extensive knowledge in their respective teaching fields, along with knowing what is needed from them to help their students succeed in their class.  A teacher is never done learning the content in their respective field, especially in STEM, as the content is developing and changing faster than it can be taught due to new scientific breakthroughs and innovations. 

### So What:

When developing lessons, projects, and assessments, a teacher needs proper knowledge of the content, and the progress of the students in the content, otherwise the activities planned will be useless.  The teacher’s engagement in the content, and their passion for the field that is being taught, and teaching itself will help with the development of passion in the students, and further the students’ learning in the class.  With my passion in electronics, physics, and mechatronics, I have developed many unique and entertaining projects that allow the students to see why these fields are so important. The “Night Time/ Day Time” project involved going beyond the scope of the class, as it involved taking an audio file and converting it into a PWM output that can be used by an Arduino, so I made the speaker output code, where the students had to find a way to involve the photoresistor.  This kept the students entertained and engaged, while learning the skills needed at the same time.

### Now What:

Because of my passion for electronics, and mechatronics, I am continuously trying to find new projects for my own personal time, which makes it easy to stumble upon projects that would be good for my students.  The robotics team that I am now the lead mentor for will help me further my critical thinking skills to solve new tasks, which I can then further assist my students with the same strategies.

:::

## Professionalism

:::{dropdown}

The teacher candidate exhibits a   commitment to professional ethics and the school’s mission, participates in professional growth opportunities to support student learning, and contributes to the profession.

### What:

Just like any other job, teachers need to be professional with their students, peers, superiors, promote collaboration between different classrooms, schools, and companies.  This involves not just being respectful to those in your surroundings, but also working on growing programs in the school and furthering knowledge in a content area.

### So What:

A large part of CTAE classes is developing a relationship between the school and local businesses.  Because of this, a lot of what I do as a Mechatronics instructor is doing a lot of outreach, and collaboration proposals to various companies.  Just recently, the robotics team at Sims Academy participated in a STEAM showcase, where we showed off our competition robot, along with some smaller robots that were able to be manipulated by the youth and parents that were at the event.  This not only helps promote my program and organizations, it also helps promote STEAM throughout our community. I have also been in contact with many different companies to try to develop a collaboration relationship and to get supplies for my program.  I have so far been able to get a class set of whiteboards, a 8 foot PVC tube for a ping-pong cannon, and I am currently working with a 3D Printing company to get a bunch of printers to make a virtual MakerSpace Lab.

### Now What:

Due to the extensive collaboration that is needed for CTAE classes, I will continue to promote my program to local companies, and our community to help develop the awareness of our developing automated society.  There are a lot of developing jobs in the field of Mechatronics, and there is no better time to start training for these jobs than right now. Manufacturing companies know that these jobs will be in high demand in the next few years, and are looking to hire, and support education in the field.
