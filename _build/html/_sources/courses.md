# Course Development

I have had the opprotunity throughout my professional career to develop a wide variety of courses to cater to many different students.  On the following pages you will find links to some of my work that I have done with Purdue University.  

A personal mission of mine is to make education as accessible as possible to anyone that desires it.  To aid in this mission, I have made the decision to make all educational works that I create open source.  If you are an educator and are looking for a platform to start your different courses, feel free to start with my docuemtnation, and modify as you see necessary.  All I ask for in return is proper attribution in your modified docuements.
