# Reverse Engineering Currciculum

One of my main works at the beginning of my PhD is developing a course that will proivde students a space to explore electronics more freely, while promoting techincal communicaton and life-long learning.  To complete all of these tasks, a reverse engineering course has been developed.  Below are the different resources for this course:

A literature review was performed as an independent study to explore how reverse engineering was being used in the classroom.  There is solid evidence that reverse engineering is an effective learning tool, but there is a gap in the ECE learning space, which I hope to explore further.

This course was the subject of a seminar at Purdue University in Engineering Education in January 2025.
