# ECE20007 Course Development

While working as a lab coordinator at Purdue University, I managed ECE20007, our Electronics fundamentals course that catered to ECE students, along with Mechanical Engineering, and other engineering diciplines.  I worked to redevelop this course to be a practical course for every student that takes it, with the hope that students will also have the curriosity and passion to explore electronics after the course if over, regardless of their disipline.
