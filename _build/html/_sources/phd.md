# PhD in Engineering Education
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I have recently taken the exciting step of pursuing a PhD in Engineering Education at Purdue University.  In this time, I hope to further find new and exciting ways to help students of all ages learn about science and engineering.  I have had the unique opportunity in my professional life to work with a wide variety of age groups, skill levels, and educational backgrounds; I plan to further work on making sure that those in the K12 space are further prepared to enter into a university or technical program, while still ensuring those that plan to enter the workforce or other fields are still leaving with effective and practical knowledge to help in a variety of disciplines.
